## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working on understanding how Flexbox manages the space given to each flexbox child. 
For further exercises like this one, I'd like to apply CSS Grid as well, to compare which method works better.
